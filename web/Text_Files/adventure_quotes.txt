Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.
J.K. Rowling
Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.
Terry Pratchett
The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.
Eleanor Roosevelt
I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing.
Herman Melville
If you don't take risks, you'll have a wasted soul.
Drew Barrymore
The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.
